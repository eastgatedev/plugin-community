## What is Neumorphism?

**Neumorphism** (soft UI design) creates subtle 3D effects through carefully calculated shadows and highlights that make UI elements appear to rise from or sink into the background. Unlike harsh flat design or heavily shadowed material design, neumorphism provides gentle visual depth that:

- **Reduces Eye Strain:** Soft shadows create natural depth perception without harsh contrasts
- **Enhances Focus:** Subtle elevation helps distinguish active elements without visual noise
- **Feels Tactile:** Elements appear touchable and responsive, improving spatial awareness
- **Looks Professional:** Modern aesthetic that feels polished without being overwhelming

For developers spending 8+ hours staring at code, neumorphism's gentle approach to visual hierarchy means less eye fatigue and more comfortable long coding sessions.
