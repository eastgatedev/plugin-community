Professional IntelliJ theme plugins designed for developers who refuse to choose between beautiful design and functional excellence.

**Current Collection:** [Neumorphism Theme Collection](neumorphism-theme/description.md)
**Future Roadmap:** Additional theme collections for specialized workflows

## Philosophy: Beauty Meets Functionality

Most themes force developers into a painful tradeoff: gorgeous aesthetics with broken syntax highlighting, or functional defaults with uninspiring visuals. We reject this compromise.

**Our Promise:**
- WCAG AAA accessibility in every theme
- Professional color schemes optimized for 8+ hour coding sessions
- Zero subscription fatigue - one-time purchases, lifetime access
- Respect for developer flow state - no intrusive trial popups

### What Is Neumorphism?

Neumorphism (soft UI design) uses gentle shadows and subtle 3D depth to create visual hierarchy without the eye strain of high-contrast flat design. Your brain processes elements naturally - like reading a well-designed book instead of a billboard.

**The Coding Difference:**
- Soft shadows replace harsh lines for natural depth perception
- Reduced visual noise compared to material design or flat UIs
- Tactile elements improve spatial awareness without distraction
- Gentle elevation reduces eye fatigue during marathon sessions

Traditional flat themes make your eyes work harder to distinguish UI elements. Neumorphism's subtle shadows let your visual system relax while maintaining perfect clarity.
