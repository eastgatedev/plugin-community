## Why Neumorphism for Coding?

**Your eyes deserve better than harsh flat UIs.** Neumorphism (soft UI design) uses gentle shadows and subtle 3D depth to create visual hierarchy without the eye strain of high-contrast flat design. After coding marathons, you'll notice the difference:

- **Soft Shadows Replace Harsh Lines** - Natural depth perception reduces visual fatigue
- **WCAG AAA Compliant** - Professional accessibility without compromising aesthetics
- **Tactile Depth Without Noise** - Elements feel alive but don't distract from code
- **8+ Hour Comfort Tested** - Designed for real developer workflows, not 5-minute demos

Traditional flat themes make your eyes work harder to distinguish UI elements. Neumorphism's subtle elevation lets your brain process visual hierarchy naturally, like reading a well-designed book instead of a high-contrast billboard.
