# JVM Lite Plugin Deprecation Notice

## Important Update

**The i18n Translate Lite: JVM plugin is deprecated as of November 2025.**

No further updates or bug fixes will be provided for the Lite version. We strongly recommend migrating to the new **i18n Translate Pro: JVM** plugin, which now includes a **FREE tier** with all the features previously available in Lite.

## Why This Change?

We've transitioned to a **freemium model** that provides:

- **FREE tier**: All Lite features (Smart Text to i18n + single language translation) available at no cost
- **Pro tier**: Unlimited languages and advanced workflow features
- **Better support**: All users on one platform receive updates and improvements
- **Simplified ecosystem**: One plugin instead of two separate versions

## What This Means for You

### Current Lite Users

You can continue using the Lite plugin as-is, but:
- ❌ No new features will be added
- ❌ No bug fixes will be provided
- ❌ No compatibility updates for future IntelliJ versions
- ✅ The plugin will continue to work on currently supported IntelliJ versions

### Recommended Action

**Switch to i18n Translate Pro: JVM** to enjoy:
- ✅ All your current Lite features remain FREE forever
- ✅ Regular updates and bug fixes
- ✅ Future IntelliJ version compatibility
- ✅ Option to upgrade to Pro tier for unlimited languages

## Migration Steps

### 1. Install Pro Plugin

Visit the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/27856-i18n-translate-pro-jvm) and install **i18n Translate Pro: JVM**.

### 2. Uninstall Lite Plugin

Go to **Settings → Plugins**, find **i18n Translate Lite: JVM**, and uninstall it.

### 3. Reconfigure Settings

**Important**: Settings and API keys will NOT be preserved during migration.

After installing the Pro plugin:
- Re-enter your OpenAI/Anthropic API key in **Settings → Tools → i18n Translate Pro: JVM**
- Reconfigure any custom settings (model selection, temperature, etc.)

### 4. Restart IDE

Restart IntelliJ IDEA to complete the migration.

### 5. Enjoy FREE Features

The Pro plugin automatically provides FREE access to:
- Smart Text to i18n extraction (fully functional)
- Full LLM translation with your API key
- Single target language translation

To unlock unlimited languages and advanced features, you can upgrade to Pro tier anytime.
