## i18n Translate Suite - Roadmap

### Vision: Complete Cross-Platform i18n Automation

Transform internationalization from a tedious manual process into an automated workflow across all major development platforms. Our plugin suite eliminates the complexity of managing translations, letting developers focus on building great products for global audiences.

#### Revolutionary Mega Plugin Strategy

We're pioneering a **revolutionary mega plugin approach** with our Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) plugin - the first plugin to combine JVM, iOS, and Android capabilities in a single unified solution. This breakthrough eliminates the need for multiple separate plugins, providing seamless cross-platform i18n automation in one powerful package.

#### Global Market Strategy

**Plugin Suite Internationalization**: The plugin suite itself will be fully internationalized to serve non-English developers worldwide, with priority focus on the China market and other major international developer communities.

### Current Release Status

#### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundation Platforms (Released)
- **JVM Plugin** (Pro & Lite) - Properties file automation for Spring Boot, Java, Kotlin
- **Web Plugin** (Pro & Lite) - JSON file automation for React, Vue, Angular, Next.js

**üéØ Priority: Web Plugin Smart Text to i18n Completion**
Completing the Web plugin's Smart Text to i18n capabilities is a foundation priority, providing the full code transformation workflow that matches our JVM plugin's comprehensive functionality.

*Over 200 locales supported with intelligent batch processing and VCS integration*

### Upcoming Releases

#### üéØ Phase 2: Mobile & Cross-Platform - The Mega Plugin Revolution (2026 H1)

**üöÄ KMP Mega Plugin - Industry First**
Introducing the world's **first "mega plugin"** that combines JVM, iOS, and Android capabilities in one unified solution. This revolutionary approach eliminates the complexity of managing multiple plugins while providing seamless cross-platform i18n automation.

**KMP Mega Plugin Features:**
- **Unified Cross-Platform Support** - JVM, iOS, and Android in one plugin
- **Shared Translation Memory** - Consistent terminology across all platforms
- **Single Configuration** - Manage all platform settings from one interface
- **Integrated Workflow** - Translate once, deploy everywhere with platform-specific formatting
- **Revolutionary Architecture** - First plugin to truly unify mobile and backend i18n

**Individual Platform Plugins** (for users preferring standalone solutions):
- **iOS Plugin** - Complete iOS localization automation (Swift, SwiftUI, Localizable.strings, String catalogs)
- **Android Plugin** - Complete Android localization automation (Native, Jetpack Compose, strings.xml)

**Ready to experience the future of cross-platform i18n automation?**

Start with our current JVM and Web plugins, then prepare for the revolutionary **KMP Mega Plugin** - the industry's first unified cross-platform i18n solution. Join thousands of developers worldwide who've already eliminated manual translation management from their development process.

**Coming Soon**: Plugin interface in multiple languages, starting with comprehensive Chinese localization to serve the global developer community.
